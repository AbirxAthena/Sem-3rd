# List of Programmes

These are the programmes I wrote for my OOP Lab Assignment.

1. **Hello World Program**
   - WAP to print "Hello World".

2. **Sum of Two Integers**
   - WAP that inputs two integer numbers and prints their sum.

3. **Sorted City Names**
   - WAP that inputs 10 city names in a character array of pointers and prints the city names in sorted order.

4. **Item Class**
   - WAP to create a class "item" consisting of item name (char array), item code (integer), and item cost (float). Includes member functions for input/output. Tests the class for two items.

5. **Employee Class**
   - WAP to create a class "employee" consisting of name (char array), age (int), and salary (float). Includes methods for input/output. Enters the records for five faculty and four staff and prints them with serial numbers.

6. **Swap using Reference**
   - WAP to make a function that swaps values of two variables using the concept of reference variables.

7. **Point Class**
   - WAP to create a class "point" consisting of x (int) and y (int) coordinates. Creates constructors that initialize the object with zeros (default constructor), with integer numbers (parameterized constructor), and copies one object from another object (copy constructor).

8. **String Class with Constructor and Destructor**
   - WAP to create a class that represents a string. Includes a constructor to allocate the right amount of memory to the string object and a destructor to destroy the objects created.

9. **Friend Function to Find Maximum**
   - WAP to create two classes each consisting of a number and member functions for input/output. Computes and prints the maximum between the two private data members using a friend function.

10. **Count Class with Static Member Function**
    - WAP to create a class "count" consisting of a number (static int) that shows on what number the object is created (using a default constructor). Also counts the total number of objects created in the program using a static member function.

11. **Inheritance - Maximum Number**
    - WAP to create a class "data" consisting of two integer numbers. Creates another class "maximum" that inherits the "data" class. Computes and prints the maximum number between the two inherited numbers.

12. **Inheritance - Student Result**
    - WAP to create a class "student" consisting of name and roll number. Creates another class "test" consisting of marks of two subjects that inherits the "student" class. Creates another class "result" consisting of total that contains the sum of marks of the two subjects and inherits the "test" class. Each class consists of member functions for input and output.

13. **Multiple Inheritance**
    - WAP to create two base classes each consisting of an integer number. Creates another class that consists of an integer number that stores the multiplication of the two numbers inherited from the base classes. Each class consists of member functions for input and output.

14. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
    - WAP to create a base class "person" consisting of name and age. Creates derived classes "teacher" consisting of post and "student" consisting of standard. Each class consists of member functions for input and output.

15. **Polymorphism - Shape Class**
    - WAP to create a class “shape” consisting of name and sides and a constructor. The class is inherited by “triangle” and “square” classes, each consisting of required data members to compute its area and a constructor and member functions to compute the area and to display the details of the shape.
