### Fundamentals of Algorithm Analysis
**Definition of Algorithm:**
```
The word Algorithm means 
” A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ”
Or
” A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.
```

### **Uses of Algorithm**

**1. Computer Science:** it is the foundation of computer programming cause it takes input and gives output within the set of rules also it is base foundation of AI and ML in Computer Programming.

**2. Mathematics:** Algo is also used in mathematics doing calculation and finding optimum solution for a linear problem also in finding the shortest path in a graph

**3. Operational Research:** it is also used in operational research to optimize things and find the data and optimal things so that we can improve Logistics, Transportation etc.

**4. Artificial Intelligence:** it is the base foundation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning it helps in making Intelligence system which helps in Facial Recognition, Decision Making and Language Processing

**5. Data Science:** it is used to Handle big data chains and Process, Analyze and Extract Specific datas from them in Many Industries like Finance, Marketing etc.


>Algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.
>
>The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.

### Why Algo is Used or Necessary?
+ it is necessary to solve problems effectively and efficiently
+ They help to automate process and make them more Reliable, Faster and Easy to use
+ They help Computer do the process or things that are impossible to do by Humans Manually
+ They are used in Different Fields like AI, ML, Data Science, Computation and etc.
