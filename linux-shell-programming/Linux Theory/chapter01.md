# **Introduction To Linux And Linux Utilities:** 

### History of Linux
+ The First Version of **Unics** was Made by Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie in *1969*
+ It was made on an Assembly Language **DEC PDP-11** by this it was not completely platform Independant
+ Then they made it in <u>C Language</u> & Platform Independent with the Help of Dennis Richie and Named it **UNIX**
+ UNIX was also not a free operating system even after being made up on a Independent Platform it was not available for every hardware
+ in 1983 it was made with **GNU Project** and became both free and open source.

#### Free Software
`Free software basically means making it free like in the term of free to Use, Change, Distribute And Modify.`

**More Precisely the Freedom was given in like four aspects:**
1. To Run
2. To Study
3. To Improve
4. To Redistribute Copies

#### GNU GPL
so whenever developers make a software they can license it under **GNU General Public License** to make it Free and Open Source, by doing this the software will be free no matter who changes it or distributes the program.  

it is like make a software copyright but not to sue or stop using that but to make and keep it free to all the public and not to restrict it for anyone

#### Linux
Development of the most important Unix system
tools mostly finished (C compiler, text editors, shell,
boot loader)  
A free, working Unix kernel was still missing.  

Then **MINIX** was created by **Andrew Tanenbaum** to study computer science but it's licensing was having issues.

So to Solve that **Linus Torvalds** the Student of the **University of Helsinki** created a new kernel which was named as **"LINUX"**  
then he made it free for further Development and Distribution.
> + Linus Created Linux in 1991.  
> + It was named as a mix of Linus and UNIX.
> + It is a popular open source operating system
> + Originally released as free software under the GNU
General Public License.
